//Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end of a string. But sometimes we need to print out the quotation marks themselves by using escape characters.
//Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author. Display the quotation and author as shown in the example output
//
//What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
//Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
//Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."

//Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
//If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, donâ€™t use it for this exercise. Use string concatenation instead.
